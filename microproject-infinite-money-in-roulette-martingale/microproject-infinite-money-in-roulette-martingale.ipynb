    "## The Martingale Betting System\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Martingale Betting System\" is a specific strategy that, when applied to the game of Roulette, involves the following actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will initially start by betting a small amount (ex: $1.00) on red.\n",
    "- Based on the outcome:\n",
    "  - **If you win** (the wheel lands on red), you will win your bet.  You have made $1.00 and you can repeat again with $1.00.\n",
    "  - **Each time you lose**, you double your bet (initially, after one loss, a $2.00 bet; then $4.00; then $8.00; and so on) until you win.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this strategy, every bet will always recover all previous losses and **ALWAYS** result in a winning bet netting a win of $1.00.  *(Ex: A $4.00 bet that wins only happens after a $1.00 and $2.00 loss, still resulting in a +$1.00 net win.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, mathematically, this betting strategy will result in an **infinite increasing amount of money** so long as you play the game long enough!  In this MicroProject, we will explore this claim and use simulation to play Roulette using the Martingale Betting System.  Let's nerd out! :)"

    "To begin to test any betting system, we first need the logic to play the game.  In the game of Roulette, a large wheel with 38 slots is spun and a ball is placed into the spinning wheel.  As the spinning wheel slows down, the ball will land in one of the 38 slots with equal probability.  Each of the slots are labeled with a number **and** a color.  Here's the exact breakdown of a standard Roulette wheel in the United States:\n",
    "- The numbers `0`, `00`, and then `1` through `36`\n",
    "- The colors are:\n",

    "    - The black numbers are: `15`, `4`, `2`, `17`, `6`, `13`, `11`, `8`, `10`, `24`, `33`, `20`, `31`, `22`, `29`, `28`, `35`, and `26`  (18 total black numbers).\n",
