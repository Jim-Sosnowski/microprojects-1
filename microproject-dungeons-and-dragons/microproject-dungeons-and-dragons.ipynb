    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Dungeons & Dragons](https://dnd.wizards.com/) is a tabletop role-playing game in which you and your friends play a group of adventurers and seek to slay monsters, meet NPCs, and become more powerful in a fantasy world. One of the most recognizable aspects is the [dice](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Dice.jpg) used to determine the outcome of events. The dice are designated by \"d\" followed by the number of sides. For example, a d6 is a standard 6-sided die. There's also a d4, d8, d10, d12, d20, and d% (the same shape as a d10 but with 00, 10, 20, etc). Fun fact: most of the dice are [platonic solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid)!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this MicroProject, you will create simulations of dice rolls and explore the statistics of the rolls. Let's nerd out!"
