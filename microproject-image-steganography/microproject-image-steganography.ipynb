Sharpe's *[\"The spectral sensitivities of the middle- and long-wavelength-sensitive cones derived from measurements in observers of known genotype\"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698900000213)* presents an incredibly detailed study of the sensitivity that the three types of cones have to various wavelengths of light.\n",

Given this finding, we may be able to slightly change the blue component of an image without it being detected, so we will limit our modifications to be only to the blue value, and only making very small adjustments.\n",

    "1. We will consider **all columns** but **only the first 27 rows** of any image (`y=0` to `y=26`).\n",
    "2. **Exactly one** `b` value in the first 27 rows of each column will be an **even value**.   All other `b` values in the first 27 rows will be an odd value.\n",
    "3. The row in which the even value was found will represent the letter in our secret, hidden message.\n",
    "    - The even `b` value in row `y=0` represents an `A`,\n",
